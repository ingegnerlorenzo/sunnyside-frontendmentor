## Overview
This project was pretty funny. I tried to replicate the layouts using mostly flexbox except for an occasion, in which I used grids. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://ingegnerlorenzo.github.io/sunnyside-frontendmentor/)

## My process
I tackled the task from a mobile first approach. At first it was all good, but then, making it good for big size screens was quite more challenging.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

I learned how to assign the "flex" properties to the parents. 


### Continued development

I want to focus on flexbox model, I want to master it at my best. It is not an easy task, but note impossible
